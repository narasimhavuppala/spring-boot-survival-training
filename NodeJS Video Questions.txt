For the last 2 years I've been working at the backend and immediately helping the Java API Spring Boot, a RESTful web services, 
micro services development,
 relational databases and no SQL databases. Working with cloud technologies. 
 and I'm pretty good with Agile with a two week sprint and 4 weeks  release 
and at the same time while using the Docker Kubernetes and DevOps tools, and the front end tools such as the Angular and react, 
so right from design to the deployment involved in each and every phase of the application development.





There are couple of instances where I was not able to deliver the user story within the stipulated time period.
 So one example is our spring security integration with the Oauth 2.0  integration, 
where I had to do with the like agility token and able to uncover the context for client credentials, password and authorization code. 
And I took one step extra and then onwards like whatever is in an experience with the newer technologies, 
I had to learn a friend and ask him that question so that like before taking up the story itself, or like I would be able to petition to handle that. 
That's why we put a lot and to keeping a complete view on the technologies and the keeping a view on the backlog is helping me a lot.


So over the last few years, I have picked up the messaging platforms such as the Kafka, which is the Pub Sub model 
and are able to work in a distributed environment, 
and I'm able to work with the Docker containers able to work with the Kubernetes for the deployment of applications,
 able to set up the CICD  pipelines and the picking up the AWS so these are the things that are very proud of.


Treat me as kind of a like a mentor for the junior level people and they call me out like very good knowledge 
on the design to the department and having a complete focus on the activities and very clear, collaborative team members
 and participating in all Azure ceremonies and very controlled to the meetings.
